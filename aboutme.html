                    <p>
                        I graduated from UCSD in 2016 with a Bachelors of Science in Biology. I worked for two years as a research scientist at 
                        a biotech start-up in San Diego conducting research on iPSC-derived neurons and astrocytes. As our research continued,
                        I began to teach myself Python to run large-data analyses and I found that I really enjoyed programming and that
                        I wished to continue my schooling in Bioinformatics/computational biology.
                    </p>

                        I am currently getting my Masters in Bioinformatics at Johns Hopkins University and I will graduate in May 2020.
                        Some of my technical skillset include: HTML/CSS, Java, C++, Python, R, MySQL/SQL, Multi-omic data analysis and visualization
                        (Genome, Proteome, Transcriptome, Epigenome), Microarray data analysis and visualization, and Phylogenetic analysis.
