                    <p>
                        After I graduated from UCSD with a Bachelors in Biology, I worked at a Biotech start-up named StemoniX in 
                        San Diego, CA. My position was that of Scientist I and I was instrumental in the development and validation
                        of our (then) flagship product of micro-Brain. Our goal at StemoniX was to develop 3-D micro-organ platforms
                        from iPSCs (induced-pluripotent stem cells) for the development of compounds to treat various diseases.
                        For our validation process, we tested the responses of our micro-Brain organoids to known compounds and compared
                        their calcium flux reactions to primary cultures as well as in vivo results. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I was also in charge of training new hires and interns for the Neuroscience team at StemoniX which helped
                        me to develop good leadership skills as well as the ability to explain complex biological features to
                        people with little to no background in the topic.
